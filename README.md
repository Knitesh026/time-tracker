**Welcome to project break-tracker**

Break Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users monitor their work hours and breaks effectively. The interface features a central time display that tracks total staff time, total break time, and net login hours. Users can start and stop the timer to log their work sessions and utilize break toggles to record specific types of breaks, including bio breaks, lunch breaks, session breaks, feedback breaks, and downtime breaks. The application also provides a break summary, detailing the duration of each break type. Additionally, users have options to reset the timers or export their logged data. Developed by Nitesh Kumar under Pagecraft Tech, Break Tracker offers a straightforward solution for tracking work and break periods.
